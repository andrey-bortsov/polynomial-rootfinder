# polynomial-rootfinder
A Java program to find roots of a polynomial of arbitrary power

* Prompts the user to enter polynomial coefficients, prints the polynomial, 
* prompts for the range and number of intervals, computes the table of 
* values and differences, and determines if there are any roots at or 
* between table entries. Prompts to recompute the table with new boundaries
* and intervals.
